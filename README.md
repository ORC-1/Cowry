This is a simple django app that 
return all the previous UUIDs ever generated by the API alongside a new UUID in a descending order

**To Run:** 

Simply clone the repo, 
you can optionally create a virtual environment running python 3.8
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python manage.py migrate
3. python manage.py runserver
4. on your browser or Postman call 127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/id/get_uuid

**Update:**
For speed, the process for saving the latest pair is threaded, this saves time and makes the API response faster.
